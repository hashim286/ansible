# Purpose

I recently started using proxmox virtualization in my homelab for testing things I need to do at work in a low stakes environment and for my own learning and enjoyment. I quickly realized that I was creating many VMs or I would need to complete a task at work that required me to perform the same task on many VMs so I began looking into ansible playbooks to replicate a task across many machines and avoid the repetitiveness of doing it over and over again while opening myself up to making errors. 

I also use it to manage my home networking equipment and work networking equipment for regular changes

Playbooks I've created for work or myself that I just want to keep in a central place to avoid manually moving them or losing them
